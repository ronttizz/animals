# Animals app

School project made using React.

When searching, app will show animals which has the exact search included in the name.

"Add like" button will add a like to selected animal and shown in the left side.

No localstorage used so the app will reset when page is refreshed.

# IMAGES FROM UNSPLASH.COM

Image search is done using template and animal name, and the pictures is based on tags, so some pictures might show something else than the animal itself.
